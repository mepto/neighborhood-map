This is a project of the Udacity front-end nanodegree.

## The goal

Developping a single page application with a map, including map markers to identify specific locations, a list view to support single browsing of all locations, a filter function for the locations.

## Technologies used

- Knockout.js
- Google maps API
- Foursquare API

## How to open the map

Download the files, extract them and open the "index.html" file in your browser.

## How to use the map

- Directly click on a marker on the map to display details,
or
- click the "Show list" button to display the sidebar; from there you can click on a location to activate it on the map.

**Close the infowindow of a location** by clicking on the cross at its top right corner or on an unidentified location on the map itself

**Deselect a location** by clicking on it when it's selected, either from the map or the sidebar list; the map will pan back to its original coordinates and zoom.
